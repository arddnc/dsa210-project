# TikTok Usage Habits and Personal Transformation

## 📌 Project Motivation
Originally, this project aimed to analyze TikTok usage specifically during final exam periods.
However, throughout the process, a deeper personal realization emerged.
Over time, I became more critical of social media platforms and observed that they often push users toward similar behaviors — watching the same videos, visiting the same places, wearing similar clothes, and listening to the same music.
This homogenization led me to consciously reduce my social media engagement.
Through this project, I validated that my TikTok activity declined significantly over the years, reflecting a personal decision to step away from social conformity.

## 📂 Data Source
- TikTok Personal Data Archive (downloaded via TikTok data request portal)
- Direct Messages section was analyzed to measure TikTok link sharing frequency over time.

## 🔍 Data Analysis
- Extracted timestamps from direct message history.
- Aggregated the number of TikTok links shared each month between 2021 and 2025.
- Visualized monthly usage trends using a line chart.

## 📈 Key Findings
- A significant increase in TikTok activity was observed around September-November 2022.
- A sharp decline in TikTok sharing activity started in 2023 and continued throughout 2024 and 2025.
- This trend aligns with a personal shift away from heavy social media usage.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, json

## 📝 Limitations & Future Work
- Only Direct Message shared links were analyzed; public interactions (likes, posts) were not included.
- Future work could involve analyzing broader activity logs and screen time data for a more complete behavioral study.
