    "## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation\n",
    "Over time, individuals undergo changes in their digital habits. This project investigates how personal TikTok sharing behavior varies across months. The motivation stems from the hypothesis that social media often pushes users to conform â€” eating similar food, visiting the same places, and listening to the same songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis aims to detect whether usage patterns declined over time, particularly in response to academic pressure or personal disinterest, and whether external context like exam periods or summer holidays had any measurable effect.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model offered better performance in detecting monthly increases or decreases in TikTok link sharing. The feature importance analysis revealed that recent behavior (previous month's data) was the strongest predictor, followed by month and contextual factors like exam periods or summer holidays.\n",

    "This project shows how even personal digital behavior can be modeled and interpreted using machine learning â€” offering insights into one's evolving relationship with social platforms.\n",
